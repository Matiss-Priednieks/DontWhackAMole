Have you ever wondered what it's like to be an arcade machine mole? Well, now you don't have to with this high-octane high-score game!

## The Goal
Play as the mole and try to stay out as long as you can without being hit by the hammer. **The longer you stay out the faster your points accumulate**, however this **resets** on getting hit.
You have 3 lives, after which you will need to restart and try again!
